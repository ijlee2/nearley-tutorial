# Nearley Tutorial

This is the code companion to my [Nearley.js: When Regex Isn't Enough](https://crunchingnumbers.live/2019/01/24/nearley-js-when-regex-isnt-enough/), presented at the Ember ATX Meetup on 1/24/2019.

You can check how the project should look after each step, by running `git checkout` and specifying the branch name:

| starter     | Starter project                      |
